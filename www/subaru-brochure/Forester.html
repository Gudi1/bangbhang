		<h2>INTERIOR ARCHITECTURE</h2>
		<p>Behind the wheel of the new Legacy, you will find your driving controls are right where you expect to find them - within easy reach. With the audio and cruise controls mounted on the leather steering wheel, and the dual-zone climate controls situated within easy reach on the centre console, everything is logically positioned with nothing to distract you. You can even answer your phone using the controls on your steering wheel.

	<h2>HIGH RESOLUTION DVD NAVIGATION</h2>
		<p>Fitted as standard on the NavPlus models, the DVD navigation system with its extra large 8-inch high resolution VGA touch screen, provides faster, more accurate guidance. An advanced voice recognition system lets you operate the system by simply talking to it. The DVD player features audio and video playback for when the car is stationary.</p>

	<h2>THE SUBARU BOXER ENGINE</h2>

	<p>Few other SUVs drive with the fun and eagerness of Forester, so you
	won't be surprised by how uniquely it is accomplished. Unlike other more
	commonly used engine types, the horizontally-opposed configuration
	of the Subaru Boxer places the pistons 180 degrees apart, for a
	lower, flatter and more compact profile. This results in the engine, and
	the overall vehicle, having a lower centre of gravity for better balance.
	Furthermore, the pistons' opposing movements inherently counteract
	each other, naturally helping to reduce vibration.
	This year, a new generation of engines delivers enhanced output,
	efficiency and emissions, while sharing all the many benefits of the 11
	million Subaru Boxer engines already produced.</p>

	<h2>SYMMETRICAL ALL-WHEEL DRIVE</h2>
	<p>Since introducing Symmetrical AWD in 1972, Subaru has continually advanced its technology to meet the ever-changing needs of our drivers. Unlike most cars a Subaru is engineered from the very start to deliver the traction and stability of AWD, with its engine and drive train in a symmetrical, straight line. Power is delivered to all four wheels simply and directly, for naturally better balance and a natural sense of control. All of which gives you confidence in virtually all conditions and performance that you simply don't expect from an SUV.</p>

	<div class="text">
		
		
		<h3>DYNAMIC PERFORMANCE</h3>
		<p>Exceptional traction makes acceleration feel immediate and exhilarating. And the symmetry helps the Forester deliver responsive handling because it's more stable during cornering, for a unique feeling of control at all times.</p>

		<h3>CONSTANTLY IN CONTACT</h3>		
		<p>The more your tyres are engaged with the road, the more control you have. Power is routed to all four wheels, all the time, in order to maintain the strongest connection to the road as possible, giving you the best handling and control.</p> 

		<h3>ATHLETIC IN AN EMERGENCY</h3>
		<p>In bad weather, or the precious seconds it takes to react to a sudden situation, the symmetrical drive train with its superb balance provides the stability, agility and traction to help you steer around danger.</p>

	<h1 class="">SUBARU ENGINEERING</h1>

</div>

	<div class="text2">

	<p> Unlike most cars, the core technology inside every Subaru comes from a perfect idea. We start by creating ideal balance by mating the Subaru Boxer engine to the permanent Symmetrical All Wheel Drive system. This technology then creates the very foundation by which a Subaru excels in all areas.</p>

	</div>

<img src="Images/forester_brigde.jpg"/>


	<div class="textblock">

	<h2>BALANCE</h2>
	<p> The layout of the Subaru Boxer engine and Symmetrical AWD naturally balance not just the drivetrains mass but its response as well. Together they deliver power more smoothly and distribute it more effectively to all four wheels, providing the superb grip and balance that defines a Subaru.</p>

	<h2>CONTROL</h2>

		<p>Unlike most cars, the core technology inside every Subaru comes from a perfect idea. We start by creating ideal balance by mating the Subaru Boxer engine to the permanent Symmetrical All Wheel Drive system. This technology then creates the very foundation by which a Subaru excels in all areas.

		<h3>COLLISION AVOIDANCE</h3>
		<p>Many of the same features that make a Forester fun to drive also contribute to its serious dedication to protecting its occupants from unexpected hazards. The stable, responsive handling of its
		Symmetrical AWD is enhanced by the low centre of gravity of its Subaru Boxer engine. Its standard Vehicle Dynamics Control, surefooted suspension, generously sized brakes and quick steering
		equip the driver with excellent evasive abilities. Even the superb visibility of its large glass area is designed to help drivers avoid accidents.*Only Automatic transmission models only.</p>

		<h3>BRAKING SYSTEM</h3>
		<p>The standard 4-channel Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) teams with Electronic Brake-Force distribution to redistribute front/rear braking pressure when the vehicle is loaded. Brake Assist provides greater force in sudden braking even if the driver doesn't brake hard enough, soon enough. And Hill Start Assist* holds the brakes for an extra second to help prevent rollback during uphill starts. *Only Manual transmission models.</p>

		<h3>RING-SHAPED REINFORCEMENT FRAMES</h3>
		<p>The Ring-Shaped Reinforcement Frames strengthen the passenger cabin from the roof down to the doors, pillars and floor. This design helps to divert and dissipate impact energy away from the occupants in a collision. The front crumple zone is integral to the frame, whilst the cradle mount for the engine and front suspension is designed to help keep these components away from the passenger compartment in a frontal impact.</p>
