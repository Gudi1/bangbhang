		<h2>VERSATILE CAPACITY</h2>
		<p>The Subaru XV can carry five passengers and pack five carry-on suitcases at the same time. 60/40 split rear seats mean the Subaru XV has the versatility to hold a rear seat passenger and a bike at the same time. With 1,270 litres of cargo volume and a nearly square rear gate and flat-folding rear seats, it’ll take on your latest urban or country excursion with ease.</p>
	</div>

<img src="Images/x_sideSht-1.jpg"/>
	<h2>LIMITED ONLY BY YOUR IMAGINATION</h2>
		<p>The Subaru XV is more than capable of keeping pace with a 24/7 lifestyle. Everything about its design – even down to the space-creating compact engineering of its rear suspension – makes it a crossover you’ll love to live with. With a spacious luggage area, it handles everything for weekend hauls with ease. What's more, 60/40 split rear seats easily fold individually or together to give you even more....space. So, perfectly adapted to add variety to your active life.</p>

		<h2>A SUBARU IS BUILT FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS</h2>

Unlike most cars, all Subarus have permanent Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive, so they're more stable in hazardous conditions. But you don't need to be an engineer to appreciate what makes a Subaru different.</p>

<h2>THE SUBARU BOXER ENGINE</h2>

<p>Few cars in this class deliver the pure spontaneity of Subaru XV. That's thanks to the horizontally - opposed Subaru Boxer engine, which places pistons 180 degrees apart for a lower, flatter profile compared with other layouts. This gives the powerplant - and by extension the whole car - a lower centre of gravity and more balanced weight distribution. On top of that, the pistons' opposing movements counteract each other, which naturally reduces vibration and makes for smoother power delivery</p>

			<h2 class="heading">THE SOHC ENGINE</h2>

			<div class="engine"><img src="pics/engine.jpg"/></div>
	
		<div class="content_block_1">

			<p>The SOHC engine delivers high fuel efficiency with ultra-clean EURO5-certified emissions. Refinements to its pistons, ports, intake manifold and 70 even its spark plugs help to make it more responsive around town, more satisfying on the highway, and cleaner running on virtually any road.

		<h3>WHAT'S INSIDE:</h3>
		<p>Passenger and cargo space come together brilliantly, with plenty of storage space and flexibility that almost defies the laws of physics.</p>

		<h3>WHAT IT DOES:</h3>
		<p>Limited only by your imagination, you know that the Subaru XV is more than capable of keeping pace with a 24/7 lifestyle. Everything about its design – even down to the space-creating compact engineering of its rear suspension – makes it a crossover you'll love to live with. With a spacious luggage area, it handles everything for weekend hauls with ease. What’s more, 60/40 split rear seats easily fold individually or together to give you even more….space. So, perfectly adapted to add variety to your active life.</p>

	<div class="para1">	
	 <h3>VERSATILE CAPACITY</h3>
	   <p>The Subaru XV can carry five passengers and pack five carry-on suitcases at the same time. 60/40 split rear seats mean the Subaru XV has the versatility to hold a rear seat passenger and a bike at the same time. With 1,270 litres of cargo volume*, a nearly square rear gate and flat-folding rear seats, it’ll take on your latest urban or country excursion with ease.</p>

	<h2>SYMMETRICAL ALL-WHEEL DRIVE</h2>
	<p>Driving satisfaction comes through symmetry and balance. That's why Subaru has been developing and perfecting their Symmetrical AWD system since 1972. Matched with the Subaru Boxer engine for a near-perfect symmetrical layout, it delivers power with exceptional traction, providing balance and stability for total control in ever-changing road conditions.</p>

		<h3>DYNAMIC PERFORMANCE</h3>
		<p>Excellent road grip gives acceleration an immediate,exhilarating feel. Symmetry also makes Subaru XV's handling more stable and responsive in cornering, giving a unique 'hands-on' feeling of control in any situation.</p>

		<h3>CONSTANTLY IN CONTACT</h3>		
		<p>The more your tyres are wedded to the road, the greater control, security and connection you have. Power is permanently routed to all four wheels all the time, making the most of handling and traction.</p> 

		<h3>ATHLETIC IN AN EMERGENCY</h3>
		<p>In bad weather, or in the precious seconds it takes to react to a sudden situation, the symmetrical drivetrain with almost total lateral balance provides the stability, agility and traction that help you steer round potential danger.

		<h3>PASSIVE SAFETY</h3>
		<p>Driver and passenger protection is a high priority in every element of the Subaru XV – from major features such as seats, to the smaller details like the breakaway pedals. Its energyabsorbing body structure is strengthened with high tensile-strength steel in critical areas, minimising the impact force that can reach the cabin, and increasing bending stiffness. There's also a whole range of advanced interior safety features to help protect occupants directly.</p>

		<h3>PEDESTRIAN PROTECTION</h3>
		<p>Made for the urban landscape, the Subaru XV responsibly provides a high level of pedestrian protection. Shock-absorbing space between bonnet and engine helps reduce pedestrian injury if an accident were to happen, as do an energy-absorbing front bumper and specially designed area around the windscreen wipers.</p>

		<h3>RING-SHAPED REINFORCEMENT FRAMES</h3>
		<p>These strengthen the passenger cabin from the roof to the doors, pillars and floor. This helps divert and dissipate impact energy away from people in a collision. The frames for the Subaru XV feature high-tensile steel designs that are strong and rigid, yet still lighter in weight.</p>
