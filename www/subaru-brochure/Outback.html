		<h2>Interior Architecture</h2>
		<p>Behind the wheel of the new Outback, you will find your driving controls are right where you expect to find them - within easy reach. With the audio and cruise controls mounted on the leather steering wheel, and the dual-zone climate controls situated within easy reach on the centre console, everything is logically positioned with nothing to distract you. You can even answer your phone using the controls on your steering wheel.

	<h2>High Resolution DVD Navigation</h2>
		<p>Fitted as standard on the NavPlus models, the DVD navigation system with its extra large 8-inch high resolution VGA touch screen, provides faster, more accurate guidance. An advanced voice recognition system lets you operate the system by simply talking to it. The DVD player features audio and video playback for when the car is stationary.</p>

	<h2>THE SUBARU BOXER ENGINE</h2>

	<p>Unlike other cars, we like to match power with balance. Few other cars drive with the self-assured confidence of Outback, so you won't be surprised by how uniquely it is accomplished. The horizontally-opposed configuration of the Subaru Boxer engine places the pistons 180 degrees apart, for a lower, flatter profile than other engine types. This gives the engine, and the overall vehicle, a lower centre of gravity and better sense of balance. Further, the pistons' opposing movements inherently counteract each other, naturally helping to reduce vibration.</p>

	<h2>SYMMETRICAL ALL-WHEEL DRIVE</h2>
	<p>At Subaru, when we design cars we take a different approach. We believe that symmetry gives you balance, and balance gives you control. That is why Subaru has spent nearly 40 years developing the Symmetrical AWD system. Matched with the Subaru Boxer engine for an almost perfectly symmetrical layout, it maximises the power delivery with exceptional traction. It also generates balance and stability for total control in almost any condition, giving you the confidence to enjoy every journey in absolute safety.</p>

	<div class="text">
		
		
		<h3>RESPONCE</h3>
		<p>Exceptional traction makes acceleration feel immediate and exhilarating. And the symmetry helps the Outback deliver responsive handling, because it's less likely to become unstable during cornering, delivering a unique feeling of control at all times.</p>

		<h3>CONTROL</h3>		
		<p>The more your tyres are engaged with the road, the more control you have. Power is routed to all four tyres all the time in order to maintain the strongest connection to the road as possible, maximising handling and control.</p> 

		<h3>AGILITY</h3>
		<p>In bad weather, or in the crucial seconds it takes to react to an unexpected situation, the symmetrical drivetrain with almost total side-to-side balance provides the stability, agility and traction to help you steer around danger.</p>

	<h3>PASSIVE SAFETY, TO BETTER SURVIVE A COLLISION</h3>
	<p>At Subaru, there is never an end to the pursuit of safety. We set high standards, constantly enhancing features while earning acclaim along the way. But even with the most advanced active safety systems, sometimes an accident is simply unavoidable. That's why the Outback is designed to protect its occupants with a series of advanced systems and features, balancing rigid strength with controlled deformation in key areas to better manage impact forces. The Cradle Mount System for its engine effectively lengthens the front crumple zone. Each side door includes two sideimpact protection beams. A comprehensive suite of airbags, whiplashreducing front seats, retracting pedals and 3-point seatbelts help protect occupants directly. It's a core value of the Subaru philosophy that peace of mind is the first step in providing driving enjoyment.</p>

		<h3>RING-SHAPED REINFORCEMENT FRAMES</h3>
		<p>The Ring-Shaped Reinforcement Frames strengthen the passenger cabin from the roof to the doors, pillars and floor. This design helps to divert and dissipate impact energy away from the occupants in a collision. The front crumple zone is integral to the frame, while the cradle mounting for the engine is designed to help keep these components farther from the passenger compartment in a front impact.</p>

		<h3>SEATS, SEATBELTS AND SRS* AIRBAGS</h3>
		<p>Standard on the Outback are front SRS* airbags, plus front-side and curtain SRS* airbags. Height-adjustable front seatbelts feature pretensioners to hold passengers firmly in place, and load limiters that ease peak forces to the chest. In a rear collision, front seats use rigid frames, firm headrests and such details as energy absorbing mounting of the inner seat springs, all to help reduce the chance of whiplash..</p>

		<h3>PEDESTRIAN PROTECTION</h3>
		<p>The Outback was designed with the objective of providing a high level of pedestrian protection. Shock absorbing space between the bonnet and engine helps to reduce pedestrian injury in an accident, as do an energy absorbing front bumper and a specially designed area around the windscreen wipers.</p>

	<h3>WHAT'S IMPORTANT:</h3>
	<p>We know that every aspect of a vehicle's design affects the way it drives. And the way each part interacts with every other part can change the way it responds to the input you provide. That's why, unlike other car manufacturers, we look at the car as a whole and craft each component of the Outback to work in harmony with one goal in mind - perfect handling.</p>

	  <div class="text1">
		<h3>SUBARU DY NAMIC CHASSIS CONTROL CONCEPT</h3>
		<p>Innovative Subaru engineering balances handling precision, occupant protection and driving passion. The Subaru Dynamic Chassis Control Concept (DC3) extends the benefits of its lower centre of gravity and AWD stability to virtually every measure of Outback's performance.</p>
	  </div>
	   <div class="text2">
		<h3>GREATER STABILITY AND COMFORT</h3>
		<p>Outback elevates the inherent advantages of its signature Subaru layout - balance, composure and response - with Subaru DC3. The body uses more high-tensile steel in critical areas to achieve high strength with flexibility. Handling is made even more surefooted and stable, while the ride is made more comfortable.</p>
	  </div>
	   <div class="text3">
		<h3>FRONT SUSPENSION</h3>
		<p>Working in harmony with Subaru DC3, Outback's strut type front suspension features the highly rigid Cradle Mount System, a wide tread and long wheel travel. Together they deliver flatter cornering as well as a quieter, more comfortable ride over a variety of road surfaces.</p>

	<h2>BALANCE</h2>
	<p> The layout of the Subaru Boxer engine and Symmetrical AWD naturally balance not just the drivetrains mass but its response as well. Together they deliver power more smoothly and distribute it more effectively to all four wheels, providing the superb grip and balance that defines a Subaru.</p>

	<h2>CONTROL</h2>
	<p>The Subaru Boxer engines flat configuration gives the vehicle a lower centre of gravity. Paired with the superior handling of the permanent Symmetrical AWD, this combination provides more precise, responsive and satisfying control in virtually any driving condition.</p>

	<h2>SAFETY</h2>
	<p>In poor weather, or in the precious seconds it takes to react to an unexpected situation, the combination of the balanced Subaru BOXER engine and surefooted Symmetrical AWD provide the agility that can help drivers avoid a collision.</p>

		<h3>COLLISION AVOIDANCE</h3>
		<p>Because we're unlike other car manufacturers, our goal is to inspire confidence through peace of mind on the road. This means bringing safe driving to everyone's lives for a relaxed driving experience, so that you can focus on your rewarding adventure in the Outback. Many of the same features that make Outback so satisfying to drive, also contribute to its serious dedication to keeping its occupants out of harm's way. The stable, responsive handling of its permanent Symmetrical AWD assures control in virtually any weather condition.</p>

		<h3>BRAKING SYSTEM</h3>
		<p>The standard 4-wheel disc brakes feature lightweight aluminium rear calipers and a strong, reassuring brake feel. The Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) includes Electronic Brake-force Distribution, to reapportion front/ rear braking pressure when the vehicle is loaded. Brake assist provides greater force in sudden braking, even if the driver doesn't brake hard enough. And Subaru's Hill Holder helps prevent rollback when starting off on a 5% or steeper slope, by applying the electronic parking brake and automatically releasing it once you're underway.</p>

		<h3>VEHICLE DYNAMICS CONTROL SYSTEM</h3>
		<p>Standard in every Outback, Vehicle Dynamics Control monitors and analyses if the vehicle is following the driver's intended course through an array of sensors. If the vehicle approaches the limits of stability, the AWD torque distribution, engine output and brakes at each wheel are adjusted to assist in keeping the vehicle on course.</p>
